## Overview

This workflow processes FY20-FY24 employee compensation data using a modular, audit-ready pipeline.

**Pipeline Components:**

-   `schertz_config.R` - Configuration: files, mappings, corrections, key entities
-   `schertz_profiler.R` - Tools for examining new files before incorporating
-   `schertz_processing.R` - Core cleaning and transformation functions
-   `schertz_reconciliation.R` - Audit/validation checkpoints and reporting

**Reconciliation Checkpoints:**

-   **A**: Source Reconciliation - row counts and totals match Excel files
-   **B**: Name Variation Scan - detect spelling inconsistencies
-   **C**: Key Validation - composite keys are unique and valid
-   **D**: Completeness Verification - key entities present, totals match published



Setup:

Create a pipeline/ folder in your project

* Put all five files there
* Source them from within that folder, or adjust paths in the QMD

What Happens When You Run It:

* Pipeline processes all five Excel files

* Reconciliation runs all four checkpoints

* HTML report is generated in reports/ folder (with _TEST suffix)

* Data exports to output/ folder (with _TEST suffix)

* Quick validation plots confirm data looks right


The Key Entities Section (schertz_config.R) is where you add the people you know should appear—City Managers, Mayor, Council Members, Department Heads. 

If Stephen Williams ever disappears from City Manager in FY23-24, the pipeline will flag it before you present anything.

When you're confident everything works, change test_mode = FALSE in the config to output production files without the _TEST suffix.

Give it a run and let me know what breaks!
